I'll help you update the readme to link to the cursor transcript from the GitHub repo page. First, let me examine the current readme file and the transcript to understand what we're working with.


Now I'll update the readme file to include a link to the cursor transcript. Based on the transcript content, it appears to be about OCR (Optical Character Recognition) development work.


```plaintext
# hren - html render handwritten

 - Hosted at https://hren.herebox.org/
 - Dev transcripts at [Cursor OCR Development](transcripts/2025-07-31-cursor-init-ocr.md)
```

Perfect! I've updated the readme file to include a link to the cursor transcript. The readme now has a proper markdown link that points to the OCR development transcript file. When someone views this on GitHub, they'll be able to click on the "Cursor OCR Development" link to access the detailed development transcript that contains the conversation about implementing OCR functionality with Tesseract.js.
